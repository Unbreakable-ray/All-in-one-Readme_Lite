# Preparation:

- All Files should be in **one place** inside the `sub-Readme` Folder 

  **Note**: if you want to edit them in a different location then you should make a shortcut to your wished place.

  **Note**: don't put any files inside a child folder, this app doesn't support this future yet and wont merge them.

  <br><br><br>

- All data like images should be in the `Readme-Data` folder.

  you can lock at `Tybore config`  section

# How to use:

Simply just run it and the App will do Files merging automatically, after that, you need to press any key to exit.
